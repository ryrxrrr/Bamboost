Our project introduces an innovative plant cultivation chamber that seamlessly integrates with iOS/iPadOS applications through BLE Bluetooth technology for precise control and data transmission to an Arduino system. This cutting-edge setup enables the Arduino to autonomously water plants based on humidity detection while also monitoring the water tank's level, providing real-time feedback to the user's smartphone for a fully visualized experience. Users can effortlessly control the lighting within the cultivation chamber via the app, including turning lights on or off and adjusting lighting schedules through an intuitive drag interface. Additionally, the cultivation chamber is equipped with an OLED display that shows the lighting schedule, enhancing the user's interaction with the system. This integration of technology and nature offers a hands-on approach to plant cultivation, making it easier for users to maintain their plants' health and growth by providing an optimal growing environment controlled directly from their smartphones.
